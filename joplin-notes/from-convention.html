<p>Collaboration and multi-disciplinary. Robert identified “Loaves and FIshes” as one thing St. Paul’s has done positively for Priority #1</p>
<p>Partnerships e.g. <strong>Habitat for Humanity</strong> + <strong>Heart for Monroe</strong></p>
<p>Power in numbers. Power in being together.</p>
<p>Cf convention center shaking</p>
<p>(Gail) appreciates Christian formation (led by Kevin) where everybody’s point of view was valued. … I asked whether there was also an energy or pressure to move up the trajectory – (advance?) (higher?)</p>
<p><strong>natural burial</strong> – someone doing. (Jewish and Muslim style)</p>
<p>(Ethiopian cross) Jermode at <strong>St. Ambrose</strong> for intersection of racism and care for creation</p>
<p><strong>Bp. Anne</strong>: it is fitting that this initiation of mission initiatives/priorities at the time of the beginning of Lent. “We will not put <strong>mission</strong> on hold.”</p>
<p>Way of life is the way of the cross is the way of God.</p>
<p>How organize ourselves as messengers – to network, to coordinate, cf. graphic. it is iterative. learning as we go. how diocesan energies maximized in the wider field. Move at own pace, local, but part of a whole. Collaboration, cooperation.</p>
<p>Doesn’t have to be fast. But it needs to spirited (spirit-filled). (Psalm 126) Be like those who dream. HEalth and safety of all our residents is the responsibiliy of all of us … immigrants as gifts not burdens … (Anne) <strong>gets the passion of this</strong>. May we see the face of Jesus in every stranger we meet. May each in our own way pick up our cross and walk in the way of the cross in order to build up the beloved community.</p>
<p>(She was the <strong>pep</strong> of the pep talk)</p>
<p>NB there are <strong>10 campus ministries</strong> in the diocese! They were “masters of the pivot” in the creative response to pandemic. NB that the campus ministry seems pretty active. The youth group (Bishop’s ball etc.) seemed quite modest.</p>
