        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p>She identified a positive indifference to whether or not the Monroe situation develops.</p>
<p>She heard the fear of failure and wanted to know more about that. Hearing me identify gifts that I bring and needs of the community, she imagined that the voice of fear of failure is in an Ignation way a voice trying to disrupt what God‘s intentions might be.￼</p>
<p>she was able to remind me that many people in their 20s are not good at communicating. Perhaps the technology thing.</p>
<p>Clearly there is no decision making until there are more particulars to make decisions about. But it seems clear that I am in a place for a new chapter.</p>
<p>my intuition that Mary Pat would like for the Monroe situation to develop. She I think longs for a connection to a faith community.</p>
<p>I somewhat flippantly said that it would mean that we wouldn’t be living next to the ocean for a time anyway…</p>
<p>￼A vision of being able to see even the people who don’t like me at least excepting me so that I am a candidate for being a pastor to all. I’m a known quantity.</p>
