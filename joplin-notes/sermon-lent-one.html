<h1 id="opening">Opening</h1>
<p>Yesterday was an extraordinary time. It was my first visit to Winston-Salem. It was my first time gathering in person with the whole diocese of North Carolina. When I returned to my hotel room on Friday night the neighbor in the room next to me ask me how long I had been a man of the cloth. I had to do a quick think and I realized it’s almost 40 years that I have been ordained.</p>
<p>The program on Friday was a conversation with two remarkable sisters. They are members of St Michael and all angels in Charlotte. And they talked about how in the last 10 years or so their Christian faith has taking a new and deeper turn in their lives. They are examples of ordinary Christians who by taking their faith seriously make an extraordinary impact on the world around them.</p>
<p>I made connections with people in the diocese and it felt natural and empowering. In the months and years ahead I hope you will be able to take advantage of the rich heritage you have here in the Diocese of North Carolina.</p>
<p>If there was one thing I took away from my trip to Winston-Salem it was the importance for each of us to find ways to build up one another in the faith.</p>
<h1 id="catechumenate">Catechumenate</h1>
<p>Last Wednesday in my invitation to keeping a Holy Lent I included a description of a process of conversion. A conversion that leads one to seek baptism. There was reference to preparation for <em>baptism</em> and in that preparation there was a prescription to develope self examination, Scripture study, repentance, and generally learning how to be a Christian.</p>
<p>This process was described as culminating in baptism and celebration of the feast of the risen Lord, Easter. The season of Lent from that perspective is a preparation for Easter but especially as the time of initiating new Christians.</p>
<p>Beginning in the mid-20th century there emerged a recovery of an ancient process for forming adults into the Christian faith. When I had my first born baptized I was still very much caught up in an old way of thinking of baptism. Thinking of it is something like a mysterious key to unlock special privileges with a card.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards I moved with my young family to begin seminary. There I learned much about the development of liturgies from the earliest times of the church. I experienced a richness of the celebration of baptism than I scarcely imagined possum.</p>
<p>In the years after that I began to learn more and more about this thing called the catechumenate.</p>
<p>I learned for example that in the earliest centuries of the church, at a time when most of the population was not Christian the formation and education of new Christians was taken with the utmost seriousness. More than one person compared the process of becoming a Christian in the earliest centuries to what we expect in the formation of a priest in our time. In some cases there was a three year process, just as there is in seminaries today, three years filled with learning and prayer and experiencing new situations while serving the sick and the outcast. Such a three-year process was in fact what occurred for Christians of all sorts of stripes in the earliest centuries.</p>
<p>All of that began to change after the sixth and seventh centuries most of the population thought of itself is Christian. We have been living in that era ever cents.</p>
<h1 id="community">Community</h1>
<p>It has become common place to quote the aphorism that it “<strong>takes a village to raise a child</strong>.” In the earliest years of the church it was very clear to all that it took a community to raise a Christian. With those who had been raised up and formed in the pattern of life and what it meant to be a Christian were ready for baptism it would have typically taken place at Easter. And there was a process at ritual and actions that took place during the season of Lent and then with more intensity during the week leading up to Easter.</p>
<p>When the new Christians emerged out of the pool of water that was used for baptism the entire community would have felt like they had been through a process of training and strengthening.</p>
<p>The initiation of a persons ministry can take different forms. I think of Paul on the road Damascus. Not from his horse in a bowl like conversion experience. Left him and insured mean Learning what it was going to mean to be a Christian.</p>
<p>Jesus gets his ministry by going into the wilderness. It is a time of fasting and prayer Learning wants to pendants on Carnaval. The gospel presents image of temptation. It’s a temptation to turn aside from what one is called to do windy.</p>
<p>So with the first Sunday of lent we have the theme of an initiation into a ministry there is much that remains to be done. The whole rest of the story in fact.￼</p>
<p>I became convinced along time ago, partly from my own experience, partly from what I have read and heard about from others, that the most important Magnifica time Christian is when they make an adult decision to serve Christ.</p>
<h1 id="adult-conversion-formation">Adult conversion / formation</h1>
<p>The New Testament is filled with adults who make a dramatic decision to follow Jesus.</p>
<p>I buy conversion occurred in my 20s, even though I had been a Christian my whole life at the active in the church from my time of being a boy. We may not have conversion experience is like Paul but there comes a time when as a mature adult we have to decide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell the story of the young man losing his fingers at Saint Andrews.</li>
<li>Story of Dale Guckenberger.</li>
<li>The story of the young couple wanted to be married someone at my invitation to come and be a part.</li>
</ul>
<p>in each case there comes a time when the easier path would be to abandon new life. The easier path is the one</p>
<p>If the whole community is experiencing formation preparation for ministry then Easter is experienced as a new beginni ng, new launch of the ministry to which the community called. Paragraph</p>
<p>Lent as a time of preparation for Easter is not about motivating or collection of individuals. It’s about invigorating the whole community into its location.</p>
