<p>A lifetime ago February 2020. So tired. When over. So much change. To survive the dry flat places.  One can <strong>dream</strong>. Psalm 126. Restore our fortunes of Lord.</p>
<p>Today hear about seeds that are planted. Await the harvest.</p>
<p>Partner with God. God does the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>How will we walk with Jesus? First step of every mission (statement).</p>
<p>Image of cross with our 5 mission efforts.</p>
<p>Imua. Canoing out of pulling it is team effort working together.</p>
<p>How do we become a church that looks like Jesus? Emulate. Becoming beloved community.</p>
<p>We live in a world that is petrified of scarcity. God calls us to joy in abundance. What fills you with new energy?</p>
<hr />
<p>Stand with those who are weakest among us. Marginalized. At the heart of becoming beloved community.</p>
<p>Testimonies of what is happening around the diocese. Love in action.</p>
<p>Joy is not the same as happiness.</p>
<p>Nb the <strong>dream</strong> theme in the prayers of the people. (<em>Psalm 126</em>)</p>
<p>“Then were we like those who dream” was used as a gathering mantra.</p>
<p>The whole gathering like a <strong>pep-talk</strong>. Sales meeting.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alice from Wilson – blending 2 cultures, search for pastor to do that. She introduced the 2 sisters.</p>
